<p>My favourite tools are Ruby on Rails in hand with JavaScript and its aweseome framework AngularJS. I'm able to manage the deployement of a rails app from coding to server configuration. I also know tools from other backgrounds like Python and Django. <br>And don't look at my picture, I'm not that serious.</p>
